# Basic Node Angular Blazor Web-Component Integration Demo

This project demonstrates the seamless integration of the `stencil-web-component-demo` library into various frameworks, specifically Angular and Blazor. It showcases how easily web components can be added to different web application frameworks, allowing for the creation of more dynamic, reusable, and framework-agnostic UI components.

## Web Components

The `stencil-web-component-demo` is a library of web components that can be easily integrated into any framework, enhancing your application with custom, reusable UI components.

### Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Angular and Blazor projects locally on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your local development machine.
- .NET SDK for running Blazor projects.

### npm Package

The library of components used in these projects is called `stencil-web-component-demo`. You can find more information and instructions on how to use these components in your own project by visiting the npm package page:

[stencil-web-component-demo npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stencil-web-component-demo?activeTab=readme)
